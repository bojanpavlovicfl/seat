This repository contains the main SeAT Repository. It can be seen as the 'glue' for all of the SeAT core packages.  
SeAT is a EVE Online Corporation Management Tool written in PHP using the Laravel Framework driven by a MySQL database. SeAT itself is the result of a rewrite of the original Corporation Management Tool that I wrote for our corp and figured there may be others out there that may need similar tools.
